Feature 1: Multiple sessions
- Server:
	- User struct now holds an array of joined sessions
	- When joining a session, the server makes sure the user is not already in it
	- Leaving a session now requires a session id and returns a packet:
		- When leaving a session, the server does the following:
			1. Does the session exist? -> return NAK if it doesnn't
			2. Is the user in the session> -> return NAK if they aren't
			3. Leave the session and return an ACK
	- Logout leaves all sessions and doesn't return any acknowledgements to the client
- Client:
	- The client has a counter that keeps track of how many sessions they are in
	- Recieve thread now handles the LS_NAK and LS_ACK packets

Feature 2: Timeout
